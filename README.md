# Random Password Generator - Side project | Spring 2019
### What it is:

A simple random password generator with uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers and symbols. Will ask user how long they would like the password to be.

### What I learned through this project:
* Practiced with simple Java commands
* Use java.util.scanner to ask for user input, then using that for final output
* Insert one string into another randomly


### Future goals with this program:
* Create a UI
* Automatic copy to clipboard
* Encrypt-a-password feature
