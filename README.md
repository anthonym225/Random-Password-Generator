# Random Password Generator - Side project | Spring 2019
### What it is:

A simple random password generator with **_uppercase_** characters, **_lowercase_** characters, **_numbers_** and **_symbols_**. Will ask user how long they would like the password to be, and what it will be used for. Then saves the password to a .txt file.

### What I learned through this project:
* Practiced with simple Java commands
* Use java.util.scanner to ask for user input, then using that for final output
* Insert one string into another randomly
* Use PrintWriter to save output to a local file


### Future goals with this program:
- [x] ~~Automatically save to a file~~
- [ ] Create a UI
- [ ] Create a mobile app
- [ ] Encrypt-a-password feature
